<title> Differance between var, let, & constant with examples</title>
<body>
<p>
    1)Var
         var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. 
         This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.
         code example-
         var greeter = "hey hi";
    
    function newFunction() {
        var hello = "hello";
    }
    2)Let
        let is now preferred for variable declaration. 
        It comes as an improvement to var declarations.
          code example-
          let greeting = "say Hi";
    if (true) {
        let greeting = "say Hello instead";
        console.log(greeting); // "say Hello instead"
    }
    console.log(greeting); // "say Hi"

    3)constant
        Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. 
        const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.
         code example-
         const greeting = {
        message: "say Hi",
        times: 4
    }
